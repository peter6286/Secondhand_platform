## Project Setup and Running Instructions

Welcome to our project! This README file provides instructions on how to set up and run the different components of our application. The application is divided into two main parts: the backend and the frontend. You can choose to run these parts individually or both simultaneously. Below are the steps to follow:

### Running the Backend

To start the backend server, you need to run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run server
```

This command starts the backend part of the application, which typically includes the server, database connections, and other backend services.

### Running the Frontend

To start the frontend of the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run client
```

This command initiates the frontend part, which usually includes the user interface and client-side logic.

### Running Both Backend and Frontend Together
If you want to run both the backend and frontend simultaneously, you can use a single command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command is a convenient way to launch both parts of the application at the same time. It's useful when you are working on both frontend and backend and need to see the interactions between the two.


### Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed before running these commands. If you encounter any issues, check the documentation or reach out to the project maintainers for assistance. Happy coding!
